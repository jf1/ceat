Cycling Environment Assessment Tool

This single file webpage enables quick evaluation of the quality of a linear section of cycling infrastructure (ie a link) by clicking on a few buttons to obtain a score. It also suggests improvements that would increase the score.

A complimentary system to evaluate junctions will be developed soon, followed by systems to combine link and junction scores into a route score.
